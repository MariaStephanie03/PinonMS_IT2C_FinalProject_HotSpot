                <p><strong>Ingredients: (MAIN)</strong><br>
                    <em>1.</em> 350g / 12 ounces Korean rice cakes, separated<br>
                    <em>2.</em> 150g / 5.3 ounces Korean fish cakes, rinsed over hot water & cut into bite size pieces<br>
                    <em>3.</em> 2 cups Korean soup stock (dried kelp and dried anchovy stock), use this recipe<br>

                <p><strong>TTEOKBOKKI SAUCE:</strong><br>
                    <em>1.</em> 3 Tbsp gochujang (Korean chili paste)<br>
                    <em>2.</em> 1 1/2 Tbsp raw sugar<br>
                    <em>3.</em> 1 Tbsp soy sauce<br>
                    <em>4.</em> 1 tsp minced garlic<br>
                    <em>5.</em> 1 tsp gochugaru (Korean chili flakes)</p>

                <p><strong>GARNISH:</strong><br>

                <p>Stir-fried octopus </p>
                <p><strong>Ingredients:</strong><br>
                    <em>1.</em> 1 package (1½ pounds) of frozen long arm octopus, thawed out in the refrigerator<br>
                    <em>2.</em> 2 tablespoons flour (or salt)<br>
                    <em>3.</em> 7 garlic cloves, minced<br>

                    <em>5.</em> 1 Korean spicy green chili pepper (or jalapeño), chopped<br>
                    <em>6.</em> 4 ounces onion, chopped<br>
                    <em>7.</em> 1 large Korean green onion (or 4 green onions), chopped<br>
                    <em>8.</em> 2 to 3 tablespoons vegetable oil<br>
                    <em>9.</em> 1 teaspoon toasted sesame oil<br></p>

                <p><strong>For seasonings:</strong><br>
                    <em>1.</em> ¼ cup Korean hot pepper flakes (gochugaru)<br>
                    <em>2.</em> 3 tablespoons soy sauce<br>
                    <em>3.</em> 1 tablespoon sugar<br>
                    <em>4.</em> 1 tablespoon potato starch (or cornstarch)<br>
                    <em>5.</em> ¼ cup rice syrup<br>
                    <em>6.</em> ½ teaspoon ground black pepper<br></p>

                <p><strong>Instructions:<br>
                            How to handle the nakji:</strong><br>
                    <em>1.</em> Cut open the heads and remove the intestines and beaks.<br>
                    <em>2.</em> Put in a large bowl. Add flour and scrub vigorously for about 2 minutes until it foams. This process not only tenderizes the octopus but also cleans any dirt or mud stuck in the suckers.<br>
                    <em>3.</em> Rinse in cold running water until it’s not slippery anymore. Drain.<br>
                    <em>4.</em> Bring a pot of water to a boil. Blanch the octopus for 10 to 12 seconds, drain, and then transfer to a cutting board.<br>
                    <em>5.</em> Cut the heads and arms into bite size pieces. Set aside.</p>

                <p><strong>Make seasoning sauce:</strong><br>
                    <em>1.</em> Combine all the seasoning ingredients (hot pepper flakes, soy sauce, sugar, potato starch, rice syrup and ground black pepper) in a small bowl.<br>
                    <em>2.</em> Mix well with a spoon.<br></p>

                <p><strong>Stir-fry:</strong><br>
                    <em>1.</em> Heat up a large pan over high heat. Add vegetable oil.<br>
                    <em>2.</em> Stir in garlic, ginger, green chili pepper, onion, and green onion for about 3 minutes until the garlic turns a little brown and the onion translucent.<br>
                    <em>3.</em> Add nakji and seasoning sauce. Stir for 2 to 3 minutes.<br>
                    <em>4.</em> Remove from the heat and stir in sesame oil. Transfer it to a serving plate and serve right away with rice.</p>

                    <em>1.</em> Combine the water, anchovies, and kelp in a large pot. Cover, and cook over medium-high heat for 20 minutes.<br>
                    <em>2.</em> Reduce the heat to low and cook for another 20 minutes.<br>
                    <em>3.</em> Strain the stock and you will have 8 to 10 cups’ worth. Set aside.</p>

                <p><strong>Make the hot pepper flakes mixture:</strong><br>
                    <em>1.</em> Combine 2 tablespoons of hot pepper flakes and 1 teaspoon toasted sesame oil in a small bowl.<br>
                    <em>2.</em> Mix with a spoon until well incorporated. Set aside.</p>

                    <em>2.</em> Add the beef and stir until slightly cooked.<br>
                    <em>3.</em> Clear a spot in the wok by pushing the garlic, ginger, and the meat to the side. Tilt the wok so that the excess vegetable oil slides into the cleared area. Put 3 tablespoons hot pepper flakes into the hot oil and stir and mix with the wooden spoon for about 1 minute, until it creates a smoky flavor but not long enough to burn. Then stir everything in the wok together into the hot oil.<br>
                    <em>4.</em> Add green onion, leek, cabbage, and onion and stir for 3 to 4 minutes until the vegetables are wilted.<br>

                <p><strong>Meanwhile, cook the noodles:</strong><br>
                    <em>1.</em> Bring a large pot of water to a boil. Add the noodles and stir a few times so that they don’t stick to each other.<br>
                    <em>2.</em> Cover and cook 5 to 8 minutes until tender but still chewy.<br>
                    <em>3.</em> Strain and rinse the noodles in cold running water to make them nice and chewy.</p>

                <p><strong>Put it together and serve:</strong><br>
                    <em>1.</em> Heat up the soup over high heat.<br>
                    <em>2.</em> Divide the noodles into individual serving bowls. Add the soup over top and include cooked seafood, vegetables, meat over top of the noodles. Serve right away.</p>

                <h3>Maeundae galbijjim 갈비찜</h3>
                <p>Braised short-rib Stew</p>
                <p><strong>Ingredients:</strong><br>

                    <em>1.</em> 15 lb 1” to 1 1/2” thick single beef short ribs<br>
                    <em>2.</em> 3/4 cup soy sauce<br>
                    <em>3.</em> 1/3 cup sugar<br>
                    <em>4.</em> 1 cup soju, Korea liquor or rice wine<br>
                    <em>5.</em> 3 to 6 tbsp gochugaru Korean red pepper flakes or regular red pepper flakes (for extra spiciness, add Thai chili flakes)<br>
                    <em>6.</em> 1/4 cup maesilaek, Korean plum extract or apple/pear juice<br>
                    <em>7.</em> 1 tsp black pepper<br>
                    <em>8.</em> 20 cloves garlic, chopped<br>
                    <em>9.</em> 1 1/2 tsp chopped ginger<br>
                    <em>10.</em> 6 cups water<br>
                    <em>11.</em> 1 1/2 lb moo, Korean radish or Yukon gold potatoes, peeled, cut into 2”x2” cubes<br>
                    <em>12.</em> 2 large carrots, peeled, cut into 2”x2” cubes<br>
                    <em>13.</em> 2 large yellow or sweet onion, cut into 2”x2” cubes<br>
                    <em>14.</em> 4 to 6 oz dried dangmyeon Korean glass noodles or zero calorie noodles (optional), soaked in hot water for 30 minutes, drained right before use<br>
                    <em>15.</em> 5 to 6 green onions, cut into 2” longe pieces<br>
                    <em>16.</em> 1 to 3 green and/or red chili, sliced</p>

                    <p><strong>Instructions:</strong><br>

                        <em>1.</em>  Bring enough water to boil that can cover all the beef short ribs in a large pot. Add the beef short ribs. Let the water bring back to boil, about 8 to 10 minutes. When it started boiling again, drain the water and beef in a strainer. You could save the broth, but it is filled with beef blood and bone bits, so make sure to strain in a super fine kitchen cloth. Quickly rinse the pot. Wash the beef one by one under running cold water. Add the clean beef short ribs in the now-clean pot.<br> 

                        <em>2.</em>  Add soy sauce, sugar, soju, gochugaru, maesilaek, black pepper, garlic ginger and water. (I added garlic and ginger at last in the video, because I forgot to add in the begining! lol) Mix well, cover and bring it to boil over high heat. Let it hard boil for 30 minutes over high heat then reduce heat to medium and simmer for additional 30 minutes.<br>

                        <em>3.</em>  Meanwhile, smooth edges of Korean radish and carrot. This step is not necessary for the taste, it’s just for the look. By treating the sharp edge of the vegetables will prevent break down and make the galibijjim looks not as neath.<br>

                        <em>4.</em>  Add the radish and carrot into the pot. Stir and cook additional 30 minutes. Then add the onion and soaked glass noodles (if you are using). Cook 5 to 10 more minutes or until onions are soften and the noodles are fully cooked. Remove from heat, stir in green onions and chili. Transfer to a serving plate and garnish with sesame seeds. Enjoy with a warm bowl of rice and kimchi!</p>

                    <em>2.</em> 6 dried Korean dates/jujube<br>
                    <em>3.</em> 10 - 12 gingko nuts or 1 tablespoon pine nuts</p>

                <p><strong>Instructions:</strong><br>
                    <em>1.</em> Trim off any excess fat. Rinse the ribs and let them sit in cold water for about 30 minutes to draw out excess blood. Drain.<br>
                    <em>2.</em> In a large pot, bring 5 cups of water to a boil over high heat along with the onion, ginger, garlic and scallion white parts. Add the short ribs, and bring it to a boil, uncovered, skimming off the foam. Reduce the heat to medium high and cook for about 10 minutes. Remove the ribs to a plate, reserving the stock.<br>
                    <em>3.</em> Strain the stock, and skim off the fat. (Refrigerating the stock will help the fat solidify for easier removal. If you have room in the freezer, the process will go faster.)<br>
                    <em>4.</em> Mix together all the braising liquid ingredients, except the sesame oil. Return the ribs to the pot. Pour the braising liquid over the meat and stir. (You can prepare the ribs up to this point the day before, and finish braising when you need to serve.)<br>
                    <em>5.</em> Meanwhile, prepare the vegetables and optional garnish.<br>
                    <em>6.</em> Add 2-1/2 cups of the reserved stock to the ribs. Cover and bring it to a boil over medium heat. Continue to boil for 20 to 30 minutes, depending on the thickness of the ribs. Stir in the radish, mushrooms, and carrots. Continue to boil, covered, for about 20 minutes.<br>
                    <em>7.</em> Stir in the optional garnish ingredients. Return to boil, uncovered this time, for an additional 10 minutes, or until the sauce is thicker and the meat is tender but not falling apart. Add the green parts of scallions and the sesame oil and stir gently before turning the heat off.</p>
